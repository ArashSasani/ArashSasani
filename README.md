- 👋 Hi, I’m Arash, I've been a **software developer** for almost 10 years, I've started development with Microsoft **.Net** technologies, mostly web frameworks.
I had a couple of projects in **PHP and Python** in my early years, I've also migrated to **Node.js** recently working with **express and serverless** and also I'm really enthusiastic to master **Golang**.

- I've started my front-end work from the early days of **jQuery** to the new era which we are all doing **React, A̶n̶g̶u̶l̶a̶r̶, Vue.js ... !**, and I'm ready to learn new frameworks.
- For the past recent years, I was really hoping to do offshore remote and also open source work, I've had the privilege to work with cool startups like [OpenScreenplay](https://www.openscreenplay.com/), [Mannr](https://www.getmannr.com/), and [PsychologyCompass](https://psychologycompass.com/). I'm also a member of [Spacestation Labs](https://github.com/spacestation/spacestation) a software consultancy.
- 👀 I’m interested in working with awesome dev teams to make dreams come true!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on remote and open source projects whether it would be back-end or front-end.
- 📫 You can reach me via my personal email (arash.sasani@gmail.com)
