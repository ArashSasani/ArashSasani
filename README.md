- 👋 Hi, I’m Arash, I've been a **software developer** for almost **10 years**.
- I'm currently working with **Node.js**, **Serverless**, **PostgreSQL** and **AWS** and also doing some **Golang** dev for my fun and side projects.
- I've started development with Microsoft **.Net** technologies, mostly **ASP.NET** web framework, and had a couple of projects in **PHP and Python** in my early years.
- I've started my front-end work from the early days of **jQuery** to the new era which we are all doing **React, A̶n̶g̶u̶l̶a̶r̶, Vue.js ... !**, and I'm eager to learn new stuff.

- For the past recent years, I was really hoping to do offshore remote and also open source work, I've had the privilege to work with cool startups like [OpenScreenplay](https://www.openscreenplay.com/), [Mannr](https://www.getmannr.com/), and [PsychologyCompass](https://psychologycompass.com/). I'm also a member of [Spacestation Labs](https://github.com/spacestation/spacestation) a Toronto-based software consultancy.

- 👀 I’m interested in working with international and awesome dev teams.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on remote and open source projects.
