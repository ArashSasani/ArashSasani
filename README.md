- 👋 Hi, I’m Arash, I've been a **software developer** for almost **10 years**. I have experience working with different stacks of technology.
- I'm currently working with **React Native**, **React**, **Node.js**, **Serverless**, **PostgreSQL** and **AWS** and also doing some **Golang** dev for my fun and side projects.
- For the past recent years, I was really hoping to do offshore remote and also open source work, I've had the privilege to work with cool startups like [OpenScreenplay](https://www.openscreenplay.com/), [Mannr](https://www.getmannr.com/), and [PsychologyCompass](https://psychologycompass.com/). I'm also a member of [Spacestation Labs](https://github.com/spacestation/spacestation) a Toronto-based software consultancy.

- 👀 I’m interested in working with international and awesome dev teams.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on remote and open source projects.
